ECSI - Evan Cooney's Scheme Interpreter

Ecsi is an R7RS Scheme interpreter written in C, with substantial contributions from Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom.
To build and run it, run `make install`. Don't worry, you don't need root privileges. It will just create a file called ecsi.out in the current directory.
If you'd like to help, I would love it if someone could help with the Makefile and the unit testing. Ecsi uses the Unity testing framework.
